## About the Solution

The idea of the App:

*Create recipes and manage their time on fire directly from the cell phone.*

### Why

We fell in love with the Framework and decided to invest a part of our free time in order to be able to get to know it better with solutions for things (problems) of our everyday.

Not counting that they go into our portfolio, that is, two solutions with just a cup of coffee.

## Prerequisites

The app is still in its early phase, so as we go out the features we'll be updating here.

## Installation

The app is still in its early phase, so as we go out the features we'll be updating here.

So if you want to test just install the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and run this project or on the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or any other IDE. (**PS:** we use the VSCode that is cooler :sunglasses:)â€‹

## Functionalities

Follow up on [Roadmap](#roadmap) to see what is already done and what is in progress.
